## About Me

I am a UI Engineer passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to empower end users. 

I get the most excited about my work when tackling big, complex, ambiguous problems in a user-centered context.

### Work

Currently I am leading efforts to build the frontend to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project/consensource">ConsenSource</a>, a blockchain platform being developed at Target.

### Recent Side Projects

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I volunteered as a UI Engineer on the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/project/safeplaces-app-development">SafePlaces</a> project, an open-source, privacy by design, digital contact tracing app that emerged from research out of the Camera Culture group in the MIT Media Lab. 

### Outside Of Work

In my spare time I enjoy just about any human-powered outdoor activity - rock climbing (sport, bouldering), biking, hiking, cross-country skiing. After graduating in 2018, I spent three weeks solo thru-hiking the [Superior Hiking Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/minnesota/superior-hiking-trail-entire-route), which runs 300 miles from Duluth, MN to the Canadian border.
